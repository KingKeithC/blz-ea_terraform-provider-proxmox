# Resource: IPSet

An IPSet allows us to group multiple IP addresses, IP subnets and aliases.

resource "proxmox_virtual_environment_cluster_ipset" "ipset" {
	name    = "local_network"
	comment = "Managed by Terraform"

        cidr = "192.168.0.0/23"
        comment = "Local network 1"
    }
    
    ipset {
        cidr = "192.168.0.1"
        comment = "Server 1"
        nomatch = true
    }
    
    ipset {
        cidr = "192.168.2.1"
        comment = "Server 1"
